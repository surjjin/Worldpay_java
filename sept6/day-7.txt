create a class Stud (rno,name,branch,sem,marks)
------------------------------------------------

For all examples use appropriate generics 
whereever required.

1) create a list of students and store 10
   student objects to that list display
   the information of each student.

2) create a list of cs students.
   create a list of it students.
   store these 2 separate list into a map with
   keys "cs","it".
   user will give a key and your program will
   display the list of appropriate students.
	if user passes cs , display all cs students
	if user passes it , display all it students
	
3) make your class student Comparable and sort
   the student objects on their marks and if
   two students are same sort them on their rno.

4) sort the list of Students on their names.
   (though you already have natural sorting order
    on marks).
